title: Make TCP connections
---

This exercise guides you through establishing a raw TCP connection between two servers and manually sending an HTTP request to a web server, illustrating how network protocols work in practice.

## :exclamation: **Bob:** listen for TCP clients

{% callout type: warning %}
You need to find a partner for this part of the exercise, since the goal is to establish a TCP connection between two of the servers you have set up for the course.

Let's call you **Bob** and your partner **Alice**.

Alice will need to know the public IP address of Bob's server. We will refer to it as `W.X.Y.Z`.
{% endcallout %}

Bob should run the `nc` command on his server to listen for TCP connections on port 3000:

```bash
$> nc -l 3000
```

{% note type: more %}
At this point, `nc` will start **l**istening on port 3000 and take over the console, waiting for a TCP client to connect.
{% endnote %}

## :exclamation: **Alice:** connect to Bob's server

Alice should run the `nc` command on her server to connect to TCP port 3000 on Bob's server:

```bash
$> nc W.X.Y.Z 3000
```

{% note type: more %}
Here, `nc` is acting as a client, connecting to the listening `nc` process on Bob's server.
{% endnote %}

## :exclamation: Communicate!

Bob should type "Hello" and press `Enter` to send this text:

```bash
$> nc -l 3000
Hello
```

It should be immediately displayed in Alice's terminal:

```bash
$> nc W.X.Y.Z 3000
Hello
```

Similarly, if Alice types "World" after that and presses `Enter`:

```bash
$> nc W.X.Y.Z 3000
Hello
World
```

It should appear in Bob's terminal:

```bash
$> nc -l 3000
Hello
World
```

You have a two-way raw TCP connection running.

Once you're done, you can close the connection with `Ctrl-C`.

## :exclamation: Talk ~~dirty~~ HTTP to Google

Let's do something that your browser does every day: an HTTP request.

Find out Google's IP address (`O.P.Q.R` in this example) using the [`ping` command][ping]:

```bash
$> ping -c 1 google.com
PING google.com (`O.P.Q.R`) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from google.com (O.P.Q.R): icmp_seq=1 ttl=53 time=0.890 ms
...
```

Open a TCP connection to the Google IP address you found:

```bash
$> nc O.P.Q.R 80
```

Now, talk to this Google server, but not in English or French, in the [HTTP protocol][http]:

```bash
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.google.com
```

{% note type: tip %}
Be sure to type **exactly** the text above. Your request must be a valid HTTP request or Google's server will not be able to interpret it correctly. If you have made a mistake, exit with `Ctrl-C` and start over.
{% endnote %}

{% callout type: more, id: http-request %}
By sending this text over the TCP connection, you are communicating in the HTTP protocol, a text protocol: you are sending an HTTP request to retrieve (`GET`) the resource at path `/` of host `www.google.com` (the
landing page of the Google website), using version `1.1` of the HTTP protocol.
{% endcallout %}

Press `Enter` twice and you should receive the HTML for Google's home page.

Once you're done, you can close the connection with `Ctrl-C`.

If you open your browser, visit `http://www.google.com` and display the source code of the page, you should see the same result.

## :boom: Troubleshooting

- If you get a `400 Bad Request` response, it means that your HTTP request is invalid. You probably did not type exactly the text above.
- If you donâ€™t get a response, it may be because you took too long to type the text, and the request has timed out. Try again a little faster.

## :checkered_flag: What have I done?

Contratulations!

Like the pioneers of the 1970s who developed the TCP/IP suite, you have established a TCP connection between two machines and exchanged some (hopefully nice) words with your classmate.

You have also spoken HTTP directly to Google's web server on a TCP connection, demonstrating the layering of the OSI model:

- You have hand-written an HTTP request, a level 7 application protocol. As you've seen, this is simply text written in the correct format.
- You have sent this request through a TCP connection, a level 4 transport protocol.
- To reach the correct host, you have used an address of the **I**nternet **P**rotocol (IP), a level-3 network protocol.

{% note type: more%}
There are other protocols in other layers at work, but these are the ones that interest us in the context of this course.
{% endnote %}

You can also now fully appreciate what your browser does for you every day.
