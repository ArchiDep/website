## OWASP

The [**O**pen **W**orldwide **A**pplication **S**ecurity **P**roject

software, enabling organizations to conceive, develop, acquire, operate, and
maintain applications that can be trusted. All of their projects, tools,
documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in
improving application security.

### The top ten
