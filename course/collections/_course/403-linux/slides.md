**Notes:**

[Linux][linux] is a family of free and open source software operating systems
built around the [Linux kernel][linux-kernel], an [operating system
kernel][kernel] first released in 1991, by [Linus Torvalds][linus].

**Notes:**

It is based on [Unix][unix], an operating system released in 1971 at AT&T's
[Bell Laboratories][bell-labs] in the United States. As it was [proprietary
software][proprietary], Linus Torvalds decided to release his own [open
source][oss] kernel.

### Why use Linux?

- Open source philosophy
- Low or no upfront cost
- Better system stability
- Lightweight distributions (lower CPU/RAM usage & smaller size)

**Notes:**

There are many [reasons to use it][linux-pros].

Note that no system is perfect. Linux also has [barriers to
adoption][linux-cons], mostly the facts that it rarely comes pre-installed and
that it requires users to know more about managing their operating system.

### Where Linux is king

- [Embedded systems][embedded] ([BusyBox][busybox] fits in 2.1MB)
- [Servers][linux-servers] (more than 75% of servers, most cloud workloads, most
  supercomputers)

**Notes:**

Linux is not just one operating system, it is a family of systems called [Linux
distributions][linux-distros]. For example, on desktop or server, the most
popular is [Ubuntu][ubuntu].
