title: The Twelve-Factor App
---

Let's discuss the [Twelve-Factor App][12factor], a methodology for building
cloud applications, which outlines twelve key principles for designing scalable,
maintainable, and robust web applications. The methodology emphasizes best
practices for codebase management, configuration, deployment, and operational
processes, aiming to make applications easier to build, deploy, and scale in
cloud environments.

By following these principles, developers can create apps that are portable
across different platforms, resilient to changes, and straightforward to manage.
For a deeper understanding of each factor and how to apply them, you should
explore the [official Twelve-Factor App website][12factor].
