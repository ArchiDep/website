### In the beginning (1830s)

**Notes:**

[**Charles Babbage**][charles-babbage] originated the concept of a
[digital][digital] [programmable][programmable], [general-purpose
computer][general-purpose-computer].

[**Ada Lovelace**][ada-lovelace] published the first [algorithm][algorithm] to
be carried out by such a machine.

### Analytical engine (1837)

Charles Babbage proposes a [general-purpose
computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer).

In 1842, Ada Lovelace writes the [first
program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note_G) for such a machine.

</div>

**Notes:**

The [Analytical Engine][analytical-engine] was a proposed mechanical
[general-purpose computer][general-purpose-computer] designed by English
mathematician and computer pioneer [Charles Babbage][charles-babbage].

In 1842, [Ada Lovelace][ada-lovelace] translated into English and extensively
annotated a description of the engine, including a way to calculate [Bernoulli
numbers][bernoulli-numbers] using the machine (widely considered to be the
[first complete computer program][note-g]). She has been described as the first
computer programmer.

### A century later (1940s)

<!-- slide-front-matter class: center -->

<p class='center'><img class='w40' src='images/alan-turing.jpg' /></p>

[**Alan Turing**][alan-turing]

Formalized the concepts of [algorithm][algorithm] and [computation][computation]
with the [Turing machine][turing-machine]. He is widely considered to be the
father of theoretical [computer science][computer-science] and [artificial
intelligence][artificial-intelligence].

> Did you see [The Imitation Game][the-imitation-game]?

---

### ENIAC (1946)

At that time, there was no such thing as a stored computer program.
Programs were **physically hard-coded**.
On the [ENIAC][eniac], this was done using function tables with **hundreds of ten-way switches**, which took weeks.

<p class='center'><img class='w75' src='images/eniac.jpg' /></p>

---

### The first computer bug (1947)

Computers like these are [electro-mechanical
computers][electro-mechanical-computers] because they were based on switches and
relays, as opposed to the [transistors][transistor] our current electronic
computers are based on.

<p class='center'><img class='w55' src='images/bug.jpg' /></p>

When you had a bug in one of these computers, _debugging_ meant getting your
hands dirty and finding the [actual bug][bug] in the physical machine.

---

### Automated Computing Engine (1950s)

<p class='center'><img class='w85' src='images/ace.jpg' /></p>

The [Automatic Computing Engine (ACE)][ace] was a British early electronic
serial [stored-program computer][stored-program-computer] designed by [Alan
Turing][alan-turing]. It used [mercury delay lines for its main
memory][delay-line-memory].

---

### Punched cards for computers (1950s)

<!-- slide-column -->

Many early general-purpose digital computers used [punched cards][punched-card]
for data input, output and storage.

Someone had to use a [keypunch][keypunch] machine to write your cards, then feed them to the computer.

This is what a **program** looked like:

<!-- slide-column 40 -->

<img class='w100' src='images/keypunch-machine.jpg' />

> Punched cards are much older than computers.
> They were first invented around 1725.

---

### TeleTYpewriter (1960s)

Teletypewriters (TTYs) became the most popular **computer terminals** in the 1960s.
They were basically electromechanical typewriters adapted as a user interface for early [mainframe computers][mainframe].

This is when the first **command line interfaces (CLI)** were created.
As you typed commands, a program running on the computer would interpret that input,
and the output would be printed on physical paper.

<p class='center'><img class='w70' src='images/tty.jpg' /></p>

---

### Video terminals (1970s)

<!-- slide-column -->

As available memory increased, **video terminals** such as the [VT100][vt100] replaced TTYs in the 1970s.

Initially they only displayed text.
Hence they were fundamentally the same as TTYs: textual input/output devices.

<!-- slide-column 65 -->

<p class='center'><img class='w100' src='images/vt102.jpg' /></p>

---

#### Unix & shells

It's also in this period that the [Unix][unix] operating system was developed.
Compared to earlier systems, Unix was the first **portable operating system**
because it was written in the [C programming language][c], allowing it to be installed on multiple platforms.

Unix is the ancestor of [Linux][linux].
[FreeBSD][freebsd], a Unix-like system, is also used as the basis for [macOS][macos] (since Mac OS X).

<!-- slide-column -->

In Unix-like systems, the program serving as the **command line interpreter**
(handling input/output from the terminal) is called a [**shell**][unix-shell].

> It is called this way because it is the outermost layer around the operating
> system; it wraps and hides the lower-level kernel interface.

<!-- slide-column 40 -->

### Graphical User Interfaces (1980s)

<!-- slide-column -->

Eventually, [graphical user interfaces (GUIs)][gui] were introduced
in reaction to the perceived steep learning curve of command line interfaces.

They are one of the most common end user computer interface today.

> Note that the GUI of a computer is also a shell. It's simply a different way
> to interact with the kernel.
