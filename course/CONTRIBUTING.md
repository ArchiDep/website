## Site Overview

This site contains the course materials for students of the Media Engineering
Architecture & Deployment course. It is one of the two main parts of the whole
ArchiDep website, the other part being a dashboard application for teachers and
students (see [`CONTRIBUTING.md` in the `app`
directory](../app/CONTRIBUTING.md)).

The content of the course organized into subjects, slides and exercises, a list
of which is displayed in the sidebar. Slides are typically part of a subject,
but can also be standalone documents included in the sidebar.

Progress during the semester is visually displayed, both in cards on the home
page and as a colored border in the sidebar. Green indicates done content,
yellow indicates due content for next class, blue indicates content that will be
covered in the next class.

Key features:

- Sidebar navigation for subjects, slides, and exercises.
- Progress tracking with visual indicators.
- Easy-to-navigate, visually appealing site.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.
- Real-time integration with the application dashboard.
- Full-text search across all course materials.
- Dark mode support for better readability in low-light environments.
- Print-friendly styles for physical copies of course materials.
- PDF generation for offline access.
- JSON export of course structure and progress data for integration with the
  dashboard application.
