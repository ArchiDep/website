## Theme Overview

The `theme` directory provides a shared Tailwind CSS theme for both the Phoenix
backend and Jekyll frontend. It includes custom CSS files, Tailwind
configuration, and build scripts. The theme integrates plugins such as DaisyUI
and Tailwind Typography, and supports a unified visual style across the project.
